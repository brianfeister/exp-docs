# EXP Documentation


EXP is a cloud based platform for creating immersive digitial experiences that take digital signage to a new level of engagement. Built on modern web standards (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript), and deployed through a cloud-based infrastructure, EXP enables web developers to unleash their skillset on a web-connected network of interrelated screens and devices for digital experiences that reach into the physical world.

To that end, EXP provides:

* A single place to manage screens, devices, sensors, beacons, etc.
* A realtime communication network between managed components
* An HTML player that allows for remote management of content on screens
* Managed data feed connections to 3rd party services for adding that data to digital signage experiences
